My problem is that when i load a save i made with mods,
it takes the old prewar map textures/something and pushes some of it though the real map
and when i disable all my mods its fine
but if i load up a save created before mods were installed (with mods active) its fine and nothing is wrong
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me walk you though this a bit better:

Step 1: create new save
Step 2: play like normal untill reaching the point were you leave the vault
Step 3: exit vault
Step 4: let it load, then open your pipboy
Step 5: relise its invisable (i alread fix the pipboy)
Step 6: Walk out the gate where you came though in the beginning (or any path you walk is fine)
Step 7: look at the ground, see that? its the old world loaded though the new one
Step 8: your done (i didnt want to leave this on a odd number)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay and remeber that if i load a save created before loading mods/someone elses save then i dont have this problem
Thank you, you can find the logs and such at the other text files on github :)
